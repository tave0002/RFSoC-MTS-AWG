This stable version is a copy of the MTS overlay with the following changes
Within the RFDC block
- The samples per cycle for all DACs were changed to 16 samples per cycle,
- The sample rate for all DACs was set to 8GHz
- All DACs "Clock Source" were set to "Tile 230"
- The fabric clock should be 500 MHz for all DACs
- All ADCs were disabled
- DAC_B (tile 228) was set to operate in the second nyquist zone using in the analog settings

Within the hier_dac_play block
- The axis_bram_ctrl, BMG, DACRAMstreamer, and clock convertor all had their bus widths set to 64 bytes (512 bits)
- The dwidth input width was changed to 64 bytes and the output to 32 bytes
- The register slice input and output bus size was changed to 32 bytes
- The DACRAMStreamer memory size parameter was changed to 1048576 (to reflect a size of 1MB)
- The constant block connected to the DACRAMStreamer had the width changed to 14 and the value to 0x3FFF (to match 1MB)
- the read latency on both axis_bram_ctrl and block_mem_generators (both ports A and B) was set to 4 to resolve a critical warning generated in version 19.
    - Another critical warning
      was present when generating version 20 that does not appear when generating the clean mts overlay. 
      However it is not a problem as the warning pertains to the .xdr file for mts setting propeties of the 
      adc capture blocks which have been deleted and as such it is just worried it's trying to set a param
      to a non-existance thing. This doesn't effect operation of the DAC

Additional changes
- The axis_broadcaster has been deleted, and the hier_dac_player routed to dac tile 230 (s20)
- A copy of hier_dac_play named "hier_dac_play1" was created and connecte to dac tile 228 (s00) and the M04AXI port of the internalRamInterconnect 
- All ADC blocks and the hier_dac_capture block were deleted to allow for more memory space in the DAC buffer

Within the memory address editor
- hier_dac_play/axi_bram_ctrl was set to start at 0x05_0000_0000 and be 1M large (with an end of 0x05_000F_FFFF)
- hier_dac_play1/axi_bram_ctrl was set to start at 0x05_0100_0000 and be 1M large (with an end of 0x05_000F_FFFF)
