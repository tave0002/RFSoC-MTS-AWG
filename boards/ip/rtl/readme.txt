The file "DACRAMstreamer.v" is used in the stable version and comes with the MTS overlay.
It is used to connect the BRAAM to the AXI-4 Stream bus. 
When regenerating the vivado overlay, the file named DACRAMstreamer is used.

The DACRAMstreamerDev.v is an edited version that interfaces with DDR4.
If you wish to work with an overlay that uses this version, rename it to "DACRAMstreamer.v" and the orignal 
file to "DACRAMstreamerStable.v", this will result in Vivado recognising that the DACRAMstreamer file has been 
updated and will allow you to refresh and see/use the new version.
